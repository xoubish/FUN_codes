This repository will contain some random codes I write for fun (or presentations). Currently there are:

- A processing code showing disk galaxies in CANDELS at intermediate redshifts in BZH stacks.
- An RBG image of the UDF (one of the deepest parts of the sky) where you can click on galaxies and get their properties (currently only position, easy to add other things.). Also written in processing.
- A translated persian poem moving on a picture, written in processing.
